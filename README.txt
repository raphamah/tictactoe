The project was done using AngularJS with PHP
The API can be found in the api folder

It's necessary to use 'composer install' inside the api folder, for phpunit!!!!!

To run the tests it is necessary to be inside the api folder and execute the following command 'vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.php ./test'

The computer was created at the easy level, that is, it does not use a game intelligence, it was merely created to show my knowledge in API and project organization
